# Fish Weight Prediction

A Linear Regression model to predict the weight of a fish based on its characteristics.

## Overview

Weight is an important metric to guage fish by for humans as it corresponds to the value
of the fish in terms of being a product.  Weight also serves as one of many references
to the health of living organisms.  The goal of this trained model is to estimate
the weight of a fish based on input characteristics detailed below.
